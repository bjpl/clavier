# BWV 846 Complete Commentary
## Prelude and Fugue in C Major from The Well-Tempered Clavier, Book I

*Johann Sebastian Bach*

---

## Overview

BWV 846 opens the Well-Tempered Clavier - 48 preludes and fugues demonstrating that keyboard music could be written in all 24 major and minor keys. This C Major pair serves as both introduction and template: the prelude is among the most famous pieces in classical music, while the fugue demonstrates learned counterpoint in its most accessible form.

**Historical Note**: The Prelude became famous through Charles Gounod's 1853 arrangement, which added a melody line to create "Ave Maria." This popularized Bach's music for generations of listeners.

---

## Measure-by-Measure Commentary

### Opening Section (Measures 1-4)

#### Measure 1 | I (C major)
**Harmonic Function**: Tonic establishment

The opening measure establishes the entire prelude's DNA. The arpeggiated figuration spanning from low C to high E creates a harp-like wash of sound. This pattern will remain unchanged for 35 measures - only the harmonies shift beneath.

**Practice Tip**: Establish even 16th notes and proper hand position. Practice hands together slowly, feeling the 'lean' into beats 1 and 3. Keep wrist flexible.

---

#### Measure 2 | ii6/5 (Dm7/F)
**Harmonic Function**: Predominant

The first chord change - the journey begins. The ii6/5 is Bach's favorite pre-dominant. Notice the seventh (C) in the chord creating gentle tension. This is the first step in a I-ii-V-I progression, one of the most fundamental in all tonal music.

**Voice Leading**: Bass moves C to F, providing smooth connection to the coming dominant.

---

#### Measure 3 | V6/5 (G7/B)
**Harmonic Function**: Dominant

This V6/5 is textbook dominant function. The tritone between B and F creates the 'need' to resolve. Play measures 3-4 together and feel how M3 is 'incomplete' without M4's resolution.

**Key Insight**: The tension-release pattern is the engine of tonal music. The F (7th) pulls toward E, the B (bass) pulls toward C.

---

#### Measure 4 | I (C major)
**Harmonic Function**: Tonic resolution

M1-4 form a complete harmonic phrase: I-ii6/5-V6/5-I. This is the same progression underlying countless pieces from Bach to the Beatles. Having experienced departure and return, we now have a template for understanding the entire prelude.

**Practice Tip**: Lean slightly into beat 1 to emphasize resolution without disrupting tempo.

---

### First Departure (Measures 5-11)

#### Measure 5 | vi7 (Am7)
**Harmonic Function**: Tonic substitute / First departure

The vi chord is the relative minor - it shares two notes with the tonic (C and E) but introduces a minor color. This is Bach showing us the harmonic landscape is richer than just I and V.

**Listen For**: The 'darkening' as you move from M4 to M5.

---

#### Measure 6 | ii7 (Dm7)
**Harmonic Function**: Predominant

Compare this ii7 to M2's ii6/5. Same chord, different inversion, different context. In M2, it was part of the opening phrase. Here, it's part of a longer harmonic sequence. Context changes meaning even for identical harmonies.

---

#### Measure 7 | V7 (G7)
**Harmonic Function**: Dominant

This root-position V7 is more grounded than M3's V6/5. When the bass has the root, the chord has maximum stability within its function. The progression vi-ii-V (M5-6-7) sets up a strong return to tonic.

**Practice Tip**: Allow a slight crescendo through M7 to M8.

---

#### Measure 8 | I (C major)
**Harmonic Function**: Tonic

We've now heard two complete progressions: M1-4 and M5-8. Both end on tonic but started differently. Bach demonstrates that there are multiple paths home. This is the last 'comfortable' tonic for a while.

---

#### Measure 9 | Am7 (functioning as ii7/V)
**Harmonic Function**: Secondary predominant

Recontextualization! This Am7 has identical notes to M5 but now functions differently. In M5, it was vi of C. Here, it's ii of G - a pre-dominant of the dominant. Same chord, different meaning.

---

#### Measure 10 | V (G major)
**Harmonic Function**: Dominant region

Bach briefly treats G major as if it were the tonic. This technique - 'tonicizing' the dominant - creates a sense of expansion. We're not in C anymore, nor fully in G, but somewhere in between.

---

#### Measure 11 | V7/vi (E7)
**Harmonic Function**: Secondary dominant

**First chromatic note: G#**

The G# is a shock to the ear trained on C major. This E7 is 'borrowed' from A minor and demands resolution to Am. Secondary dominants are 'temporary visitors' that point to the next chord.

---

### Sequential Development (Measures 12-19)

#### Measure 12 | vi (A minor)
**Harmonic Function**: Tonic substitute

Resolution of V/vi from M11. We've heard this Am sonority three times now (M5, M9, M12), each time with different meaning. This is the genius of tonal harmony - context determines function.

---

#### Measure 13 | V7/ii (A7)
**Harmonic Function**: Secondary dominant of ii

**Chromatic note: C#**

The Am of M12 transforms into A7 (dominant of D). This is called 'mutating' a chord - it keeps the root but changes quality to point to the next destination.

---

#### Measure 14 | ii (D minor)
**Harmonic Function**: Predominant

The sequence has brought us to D minor. Notice how naturally we arrived through the chain of fifths. Each link (V/x - x) creates its own mini-resolution while propelling the larger progression forward.

---

#### Measure 15 | V7/V (D7)
**Harmonic Function**: Secondary dominant of V

**Chromatic note: F#**

The V/V is one of the most important secondary dominants - a 'double dominant.' The F# is the leading tone of G, creating powerful forward motion toward a major structural point.

---

#### Measure 16 | V (G major)
**Harmonic Function**: Structural dominant

**MAJOR STRUCTURAL ARRIVAL**

The sequential chain (E7-Am-A7-Dm-D7-G) has reached its goal: the dominant. This is a major structural arrival. The sequence was not random wandering but a directed journey to this point.

---

#### Measure 17 | V7/IV (C7)
**Harmonic Function**: Secondary dominant of IV

**Chromatic note: Bb**

After establishing the dominant, Bach now looks toward the subdominant. The Bb turns C into a dominant seventh pointing to F. This expands the harmonic palette in the opposite direction.

---

#### Measure 18 | IV (F major)
**Harmonic Function**: Subdominant

The IV chord provides a warm, 'plagal' color. Bach balances dominant and subdominant exploration to create a complete harmonic picture. A moment of relative calm.

---

#### Measure 19 | viio7/V (F#dim7)
**Harmonic Function**: Secondary leading-tone chord

**MAXIMUM DISSONANCE**

**Two chromatic notes: F# and Eb**

The diminished seventh is the most unstable chord in tonal harmony - every note wants to resolve. This chord creates almost unbearable tension before the climax.

---

### Climactic Passage (Measures 20-24)

#### Measure 20 | V6/5 (G7/B)
**Harmonic Function**: Climactic dominant

**CLIMACTIC MOMENT**

After the extreme tension of M19, this V6/5 is both resolution and new tension. This is the climactic turning point - the 'top of the arch' before descent to final resolution.

---

#### Measure 21 | I6 (C/E)
**Harmonic Function**: Tonic (first inversion)

The first inversion tonic is resolution but with a 'but...' attached. The E in bass keeps the music moving. Bach begins a series of alternating I6 and V chords.

---

#### Measure 22 | V4/3 (G7/F)
**Harmonic Function**: Dominant (third inversion)

The V4/3 has the 7th (F) in the bass - the most unstable note of the chord in the lowest position. Maximum urgency for resolution.

---

#### Measure 23 | I6 (C/E)
**Harmonic Function**: Tonic (first inversion)

The repetition of I6-V4/3-I6 creates a 'rocking' motion that builds anticipation. Each resolution is incomplete.

---

#### Measure 24 | V6 (G/B)
**Harmonic Function**: Dominant (first inversion)

This V6 (without the 7th) is 'lighter' than the V7 chords we've heard. Bach is preparing for the final section rather than creating immediate resolution pressure.

---

### Return and Preparation (Measures 25-31)

#### Measure 25 | I (C major)
**Harmonic Function**: Tonic (root position)

First truly stable tonic since M8. This is NOT the final cadence - maintain forward motion!

---

#### Measure 26 | V6/5/IV (C7/E)
**Harmonic Function**: Secondary dominant of IV

**Chromatic note: Bb**

One last detour! The V7/IV returns, reminding us of M17's subdominant exploration. The Bb is a 'farewell' to chromaticism.

---

#### Measure 27 | IV (F major)
**Harmonic Function**: Subdominant

Last visit to F major region. Warm color before dominant pedal. From here, everything moves toward final resolution.

---

#### Measure 28 | viio6/5 (Bdim7/D)
**Harmonic Function**: Leading-tone chord

**Chromatic note: Ab**

The viio7 is V7 without the root - pure leading-tone function. The Ab desperately wants to resolve down to G.

---

#### Measure 29 | I6 (C/E)
**Harmonic Function**: Tonic (first inversion)

The bass is working its way down: F-E-D... preparing for the low G that will anchor the dominant pedal.

---

#### Measure 30 | V4/3 (G7/F)
**Harmonic Function**: Dominant (third inversion)

The bass F is about to give way to the long G pedal.

---

#### Measure 31 | I6 (C/E)
**Harmonic Function**: Tonic (first inversion)

Last 'mobile' harmony before the bass locks onto the dominant pedal.

---

### Pedal Point and Resolution (Measures 32-35)

#### Measure 32 | V (G pedal)
**Harmonic Function**: Dominant pedal begins

The dominant pedal is the ultimate tension-builder. By holding the G in the bass for four measures while harmonies shift above, Bach creates a sense of 'waiting' for resolution.

---

#### Measure 33 | V7 (G7 pedal)
**Harmonic Function**: Dominant seventh on pedal

The 7th is added to the pedal, creating more tension. The F wants to resolve to E.

---

#### Measure 34 | V7 (G7 pedal with passing tones)
**Harmonic Function**: Intensified dominant pedal

**Chromatic note: Eb (passing)**

The climax of the pedal section. Maximum tension before maximum release.

---

#### Measure 35 | I (C major)
**Harmonic Function**: Final tonic

**FINAL RESOLUTION**

The final C major is the same notes as M1 but carries the weight of everything we've experienced. This is what 'home' means in music.

# FUGUE IN C MAJOR

**Key**: C major | **Time**: 4/4 | **Voices**: 4 (SATB) | **Measures**: 27 | **Duration**: 1:30-2:00

## Subject Analysis

**Measures**: 1-2
**Character**: Stately, diatonic, clearly defining C major
**Motion**: Stepwise ascent outlining tonic triad, leap to dominant, descending return
**Rhythm**: Half note beginning, quarter notes, characteristic 8th-note figure

## Structural Overview

| Section | Measures | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Exposition | 1-8 | All four voices enter with Subject/Answer |
| Episode 1 | 7-8 | Brief sequential passage |
| Middle Entries 1 | 9-13 | Subject entries in related keys |
| Episode 2 | 14-15 | Sequential development |
| Middle Entries 2 | 16-20 | Further entries, stretto begins |
| Final Section | 21-27 | Culminating entries and final cadence |

---

## Measure-by-Measure Commentary

### Exposition (Measures 1-8)

#### Measure 1-2 | Subject in Soprano
**Key**: C major (I)
**Voices**: S: Subject; A/T/B: Silent

The Subject is the fugue's DNA - everything else derives from it. Bach presents it alone so we can memorize its contour. The rising motion from C to G outlines the tonic-dominant axis that will govern the entire fugue.

---

#### Measure 3-4 | Answer in Alto
**Key**: G major (V)
**Voices**: S: Countersubject; A: Answer

**COUNTERSUBJECT BEGINS**

The Answer in the dominant is fundamental to fugal structure. Meanwhile, the Countersubject (Soprano) provides continuous 8th-note motion. This S-CS pairing will recur throughout.

---

#### Measure 5-6 | Subject in Tenor
**Key**: C major (I)
**Voices**: S: Free counterpoint; A: Countersubject; T: Subject

**THREE-VOICE TEXTURE**

The third entry returns to tonic, following the standard S-D-T pattern. Notice how the Countersubject 'transfers' from Soprano to Alto.

---

#### Measure 7-8 | Answer in Bass
**Key**: G major (V)
**Voices**: All four active

**EXPOSITION COMPLETE**

All four voices have stated the Subject or Answer: S (Subject), A (Answer), T (Subject), B (Answer). This alternation ensures harmonic balance between tonic and dominant.

---

### Middle Entries (Measures 9-14)

#### Measure 9-10 | Subject in A minor
**Key**: vi (relative minor)
**Event**: First middle entry

Middle entries explore the Subject in related keys. A minor is the relative minor - closely related but with different color. This expands the fugue's harmonic range.

---

#### Measure 11-12 | Subject in G major
**Key**: V (dominant)
**Event**: Subject in Bass

The dominant key is the most important related key. A Subject entry here reinforces the tonic-dominant polarity.

---

#### Measure 13-14 | Episode
**Event**: Sequential passage

Episodes use fragments of the Subject and Countersubject in sequences. They provide contrast and allow harmonic motion to new key areas.

---

### Intensification (Measures 15-20)

#### Measure 15-16 | Subject in Soprano
**Key**: Return toward I
**Event**: Structural return

The Soprano's return with the Subject mirrors the opening. This cyclical element gives the fugue architectural coherence.

---

#### Measure 17-18 | Subject in Tenor
**Event**: Increasing density

In the later stages, entries come closer together. This 'compression' creates intensity.

---

#### Measure 19-20 | Stretto
**Event**: Overlapping Subject entries

**CLIMACTIC TECHNIQUE**

Stretto is the ultimate fugal technique - Subject entries that overlap before the previous entry finishes. This creates maximum intensity. Bach shows mastery: the Subject works in combination with itself!

---

### Final Section (Measures 21-27)

#### Measure 21-23 | Pre-cadential passage
**Event**: Preparing conclusion

After the stretto climax, the texture clarifies. The harmony moves toward the final cadence.

---

#### Measure 24-26 | Final entries and cadence
**Event**: V-I motion

The final measures use conventional V-I motion with all the weight of the preceding fugue behind it.

---

#### Measure 27 | Final chord
**Key**: I (C major)
**Event**: Perfect authentic cadence

**FINAL RESOLUTION**

All four voices arrive at notes of the C major chord, all tensions resolved, all motion completed. The first of 48 Preludes and Fugues stands complete.

---

## Pedagogical Summary

### Prelude Key Takeaways

1. Broken chord figuration as sole texture - harmony IS the content
2. Progressive harmonic journey: I - departures - chromaticism - return
3. Chain of secondary dominants creates forward motion
4. Dominant pedal creates maximum tension before final resolution
5. Same tonic sonority means different things at different structural points

### Fugue Key Takeaways

1. Exposition presents Subject in all four voices (alternating tonic/dominant)
2. Middle entries explore related keys (vi, V, etc.)
3. Episodes develop motives through sequence
4. Stretto creates climactic intensity through overlapping entries
5. Final section brings thematic and harmonic resolution

### Practice Recommendations

**Prelude:**
- First learn the hand shape for each chord, then connect them
- Listen for harmonic color changes, not just notes
- Practice the pedal section separately - feel the tension

**Fugue:**
- Learn to hear and identify the Subject in all four voices
- Practice each voice separately, then in pairs, then all together
- Understand the structure before focusing on speed
