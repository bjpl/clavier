Simple binary form presents two distinct sections without significant thematic return, while rounded binary form brings back opening material in the second half after developmental passages. The first section typically establishes the tonic before modulating to a contrasting key area, creating harmonic tension that the second section resolves by returning home. This structure provided the foundation for later sonata form development. Bach often expanded binary principles, blurring boundaries through continuous motivic development while maintaining the essential two-part harmonic journey."

Bach adapted ritornello principles to keyboard music, creating imaginary dialogues between 'tutti' ritornellos and 'solo' episodes.

This question-answer relationship appears throughout Western music, from folk songs to symphonies.

The presentation typically occupies half the sentence, stating a basic idea twice (exactly or varied). The continuation compresses and fragments this material, increasing harmonic rhythm and melodic activity, building toward the cadential goal.

What makes a motive memorable might be its rhythm (the 'short-short-short-long' of Beethoven's Fifth), its contour (rising vs. falling), its intervals (distinctive leaps or steps), or some combination. Bach's contrapuntal mastery rests on motivic economy: generating entire movements from tiny musical cells through repetition, transposition, inversion, fragmentation, and combination. Identifying core motives unlocks a composition's structural logic, revealing how surface variety emerges from underlying unity. The relationship between motive and subject parallels that between word and sentence—motives combine to form themes, which in turn generate complete musical thoughts."

Sequences generate momentum and connect key areas, serving as primary developmental tools in Baroque music. They may be real (exact transposition) or tonal (adjusted to fit the key).",
        "detailed": "The sequence ranks among Baroque music's most characteristic developmental techniques, capable of extending ideas indefinitely while maintaining interest through systematic transposition. Melodic sequences move a figure through successive pitch levels, typically descending by step or circle of fifths. Real sequences preserve exact intervals, potentially introducing accidentals; tonal sequences adjust intervals to remain diatonic. Sequences create irresistible forward momentum—once the pattern establishes, listeners anticipate its continuation. Bach employs sequences extensively in episodes, transitions, and development sections, often combining sequential melody with sequential harmony (falling fifths, ascending steps). The technique's danger lies in mechanical predictability; Bach's sequences succeed through subtle variation and timely departure."

        "detailed": "Fortspinnung (German: 'spinning forth') describes the Baroque aesthetic of continuous development that distinguishes it from Classical theme-and-contrast structures. A composition employing Fortspinnung presents an initial idea, then extends it through relentless development: sequences transpose the material, fragmentation isolates components, diminution increases activity, combination layers fragments contrapuntally. The result is music that perpetually renews itself while maintaining organic connection to its source. This technique embodies Baroque rhetoric—the art of elaboration and amplification. Bach's fugue episodes epitomize Fortspinnung, spinning subject fragments into extended passages that seem to generate themselves inevitably. Understanding Fortspinnung reveals why Baroque movements often feel like unified streams rather than sectional structures."

The form comprises two Stollen (stanzas) with identical music, followed by an Abgesang (aftersong) with contrasting material. This AAB structure proved ideally suited to Lutheran chorales: the repeated Stollen establish congregational familiarity; the Abgesang provides developmental interest. Bach inherited this tradition, harmonizing hundreds of chorales that retain Barform proportions. The influence extends beyond chorales: many Baroque themes exhibit AAB proportions, and the larger pattern of statement-restatement-departure underlies diverse formal schemes. Recognizing Barform connections reveals Bach's deep roots in German musical tradition."
